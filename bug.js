```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration
module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'], // Make sure your content array includes all the files you are using Tailwind in.
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-color': '#abcdef',
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
This configuration is missing the `content` array or the paths within the content array are incorrect, preventing Tailwind from finding and processing your HTML, JSX, or TSX files. As a result, your custom styles are not applied.  Make sure all files where you use Tailwind classes are correctly included in `content` array.
